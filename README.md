# General project

The purpose of this project is to develop a network of sensors and actuators managed by a smartphone or a computer for real time monitoring. The sensors and actuators are designed to be plugged onto an electric line with short pulses of a maximum of 10KV (for example an energizer) and send updates back to the server on current continuity, allowing immediate detection of any breakage on the line. The project uses electronic devices for end user monitoring with both an Android and desktop application, a master device, and up to 255 slave devices. Here a server application is used to emulate the electronic aspect and the embedded server.

See below the project schematic.

# List of projects
### [Android Client application:](https://github.com/KilianLeport/androidClientApplication)
The application was developed in Java. The main pattern used the Model View Presenter design pattern. The Views are passive and their only purpose is to display information and transmits the interactions between the View and the user to the Presenter. Each View has a its own Presenter. The Model communicates with the network and stores data. The view doesn't access the model, only the Presenters communicate with the Model.
Each Presenter subscribes to the ModelManager when their respective Views run the "onResume()" life cycle and unsubscribe when their respective Views run the "onPause()" life cycle.

See below the general implementation of the application.

#### MVP implementation example:
1. The View 'MainActivity' instantiates the 'MainPresenterInt' interface to communicate with its Presenter. The user clicks on the connection button in the View, the View then notifies the Presenter.
2. The Presenter 'MainPresenter' instantiates the 'ModelManagerInt' interface to communicate with the Model. The 'MainPresenter' class asks the Model to connect to the server.
3. The 'ModelManager' instantiates a list of instances from 'PresentersInt'. It notifies all of them that a connection has been established.
4. The 'MainPresenter' instantiates the 'MainActivityInt' interface. It notifies the 'MainActivity' to change the state of the connection button.

### [Desktop client application:](https://github.com/KilianLeport/desktopClientApplication)
The desktop application was developed in C++ with Qt. The application uses a Qt Model View Controller design pattern that is mainly a Model View design pattern [(see Qt website)](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/model-view-programming.html).
The application is mainly composed of three Views:
* DeviceListWidget that implements a QTableView which lists the devices and allows the users to control them,
* FieldViewerWidget that implements a graphic view of the device network (To-do: see Improvements section),
* LogViewerWidget that implement a QPlainTextEdit to see debug, error, and other informations.

See below the general implementation of the application.

### [Server Emulator application:](https://github.com/KilianLeport/serverEmulatorApplication) 
The Server Emulator application was developed to test the client applications. This application emulates the server and the sensor network. 
This application can:
* simulate the TCP server
* simulate the UDP server to answer the IP and the PORT of the TCP server
* simulate a list of devices that are present on a virtual network
* simulate a loss of communication with those devices
* simulate a delay in communication with each device
* save a configuration for the sensor network 

See below the general implementation of the application.

# Improvements
- [ ] Change the emulation of the sensor network in the Server Emulator Application
- [ ] Add the possibility to draw links between devices in the graphic view of the different client applications
